Spring Data JPA
·       Spring Data JPA is a powerful library within the spring framework that makes data access in Java applications using JPA (Java Persistence API) much easier and more efficient.
·   	Purpose:
o   Simplifies working with relational databases in your spring applications.
o   Eliminates the need for writing boilerplate code for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations and complex queries.
·       Spring Data JPA will provide implementation for all DAO operations using Proxy Design Pattern.
Benefits:
·       Improved developer experience:
o    Focus on the business logic of your application instead of data access details.
·       Increased productivity:
o   Faster development cycles due to simplified data access methods.
·       Automatic entity mapping:
o   Spring Data JPA automatically maps your POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to database tables based on annotations and conventions, saving you time and effort.
·       Support for complex queries:
o   While providing convenience for basic operations, Spring Data JPA still allows for building complex queries using JPA's Criteria API or QueryDSL for specific needs.
·       Reduced boilerplate code:
o   The Spring Data JPA provides the default implementation for common methods by its repository interfaces.
o   No more manual creation of DAOs (Data Access Objects) or writing extensive SQL queries.
·       Spring Data JPA we can execute queries in 3 ways
o   Using Pre-defined Methods (Repository in built methods)
o   By Writing findBy Methods (Spring DSL)
o   By Writing custom Queries (@Query)
How it works:
·       Create Java classes annotated with JPA annotations to represent your database entities.
·       Define repository interfaces extending Spring Data JPA interfaces like JpaRepository or CrudRepository.
·       Spring Data JPA automatically generates implementations for these interfaces at runtime, handling data access logic based on the methods you define.


Database Connection Properties:


spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/devflipkart?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true 
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

 
JPA Annotations:
1. 	@Entity:
·       The java class which represents DB Table structure is called as Entity class
·   	The class which is mapped with DB Table is called as Entity Class
·   	It is class level annotation
·   	It is mandatory annotation
2. 	@Table:
·       It is used to map class name to particular name
·   	It is class level annotation
·   	It is optional annotation
·       If @Table is not mentioned then SB Data considers our class name as table name
3. 	@Id:
·       It is represent variable which mapped with PK
·   	It is field level annotation
·   	It is mandatory annotation
4. 	@Column:
·       It is used to map entity class variable name with table column name
·   	It is field level annotation
·   	It is optional annotation
·       If we don't use @Column, SB data will consider variable name as column name
5. 	@GeneratedValue (strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
·   	It is database dependent
·   	Doesn't support for Oracle
·       Supports for MySQL
Schema Generation
·       ORM frameworks are having support to generate schema in runtime
·       ORM frameworks can create table and can create sequence in runtime required for app
·       By Default, Schema Generation mode will be OFF
·       To enable schema generation, we will use ddl-auto property
o   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create/create-drop/update
·       We have several possible values for ddl-auto property
o   Create
o   Create-drop
o   Update
o   Validate
o   None
·       create: means every time new table will be created
·       create-drop: it creates table and drops table at end of operation
·       update: If table is not available it will create if table is already available it will                                                                                                 	just perform operation
·   	validate: It is used to validate schema details
Domain Specific Language (DSL):
·       Spring data JPA not only provides implementation for commonly used methods but also provides a way to add custom methods.
·       Spring Data JPA QueryDSL:
